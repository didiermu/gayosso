                           <h5>Introduction</h5>
                           <p>
                              When I joined Insulet as the UX Manager,
                              overseeing the localization of our primary apps,
                              the program was just beginning. To achieve
                              Insulet’s ambitious goals of expanding into
                              international markets, including those with
                              right-to-left languages, I hired and onboarded new
                              UX team members to tackle these challenges.
                              Concurrently, Insulet’s localization process was
                              being restructured, and the emerging
                              cross-functional team explored various strategies
                              to navigate this transition. We iterated on ways
                              to clarify direction, considering critical
                              elements required for scalable translation and
                              localization, cohesive design strategies for
                              Insulet as a global platform, and the complexities
                              of working with partners like Abbott, Dexcom, and
                              Glooko.
                           </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="col-12">
                           <h5>Outcome</h5>
                           <p>
                              We are nearing the completion of a second approach
                              that could become a streamlined, robust, and
                              cohesive localization process. With the help of
                              LLM tools, the team is now aligned and equipped to
                              handle the challenges of localization. We have
                              transitioned from initial uncertainty to a
                              position of confidence and creativity, ready to
                              deliver localized versions of our main app
                              efficiently. My role involved providing hands-on
                              support for the strategy, optimizing existing
                              processes, and establishing new ones to ensure
                              brand and content consistency in a scalable
                              manner. Tactically, this included ensuring a
                              successful migration from Sketch to Figma,
                              configuring dynamic content for different markets,
                              and implementing new tools and plugins.

                           <p>
                              An executive decision to centralize localization
                              within the UX team, although unconventional,
                              proved advantageous. Several decisions emerged as
                              the team prepared to localize two critical
                              revenue-generating apps.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              One app was already localized and on the market,
                              with no major updates planned. Introducing
                              additional languages, including right-to-left and
                              logographic/alphabetic-syllabic scripts, added new
                              complexities. On the other hand, the upcoming
                              flagship product was in the midst of defining and
                              refining key features and had not been localized
                              previously. Legacy code further complicated the
                              localization process, despite the simpler initial
                              focus on markets with Latin/Romance languages.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Both scenarios were pivotal in shaping the
                              overarching strategy aimed at establishing a
                              robust foundation. From a user experience
                              standpoint, the UX team identified three key areas
                              that formed the cornerstone of our localization
                              strategy, especially in managing integrations with
                              major industry players such as Abbott, Dexcom, and
                              Glooko:
                           </p>

                           <h4>1. Branding and Content Consistency</h4>
                           <p>
                              Ensuring a cohesive visual design and brand
                              identity across multiple integrations is critical.
                              Each partner has its own design guidelines, which
                              can lead to inconsistencies in the app's
                              appearance and user experience.

                              A visual content strategy that allows for our
                              partners’ specifications and identity while
                              emphasizing Insulet’s brand, serves as a guiding
                              principle to achieve consistency across all
                              markets. For instance, I am leading an ongoing
                              initiative to develop a unified design system,
                              establishing guidelines for color schemes,
                              typography, iconography, and other visual
                              elements. This system ensures that the app
                              maintains a consistent visual identity across all
                              integrations and markets, supporting a seamless
                              user experience. While our team hasn't achieved
                              complete uniformity across platforms (iOS and
                              Android), I am steering the effort to steadily
                              approach that goal.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Additionally, maintaining Insulet’s brand involved
                              ensuring consistency in terminology and cultural
                              and medical appropriateness, achieved through the
                              development of a comprehensive glossary of terms.
                              This glossary standardized translations across all
                              languages and regions, encompassing
                              industry-specific terminology, brand-specific
                              terms, and commonly used product-related phrases.
                              Its implementation ensured translation
                              consistency, reduced ambiguities, and preserved
                              the brand’s voice across different languages.
                              Moreover, it expedited the translation process by
                              providing a definitive reference for translators.
                              Regular updates and proper utilization of this
                              glossary were crucial, empowering the responsible
                              team to resolve conflicts effectively.

                           <h4>2. Adoption of a Global Design Mindset</h4>
                           <p>
                              Having a global design mindset may sound simple.
                              One might think that generating responsive specs
                              and following accessibility practices is
                              sufficient. For the UX team at Insulet, this was a
                              good start, but we needed to review our responsive
                              specifications for the product in the
                              maturity/maintenance phase, as these
                              specifications did not originally account for
                              languages that expanded greatly or had different
                              formats. In this context, one of my teams focused
                              solely on redesigning UI layouts to adapt to
                              different text lengths and ensuring all UI
                              elements were tested for responsiveness.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              For the product in the expansion phase, we had to
                              redesign some layouts, but we were fortunate that
                              some features were still under development. The
                              strategy here was to create designs that prevented
                              UI issues arising from text expansion or
                              contraction in different languages. This ensures a
                              uniform user experience across all localized
                              versions of the app (on Android and iOS),
                              maintaining usability and aesthetic integrity. We
                              aim to create an experience for all markets that
                              is at least as good as the one for the US. I am
                              proud to champion consistency across markets,
                              ensuring a standard experience regardless of
                              country or language.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              As the team and the process matured, I co-led the
                              UX team to focus on designing a global product for
                              users with diverse cultural backgrounds but the
                              same goal: to have the best quality, safe, and
                              simple insulin delivery. Having fully flexible and
                              responsive mockups was just the beginning of our
                              product's expansion as the market and ecosystem
                              grew (and continues to grow). This is particularly
                              important for the universe of devices on the
                              Android platform, including the recent foldable
                              devices, and to support right-to-left languages on
                              both Android and iOS.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              In parallel, as we migrated from Sketch to Figma,
                              I asked the team to rebuild our components and
                              screens to be fully responsive. This was a bold
                              decision at the time as the design team was not
                              yet aligned, but I’m glad I made it with the
                              support of my peers and manager. It allowed us to
                              reuse these screens in other supporting products,
                              positioning us well for the future.
                           </p>

                           <h4>3. Dynamic Content Management</h4>
                           <p>
                              The last and most challenging piece was building
                              the infrastructure to share the same strings
                              between the code build and the UX files.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              We have only just begun, and the scope currently
                              includes only the product in the expansion phase.
                              I can see why this might not have been feasible
                              three years ago. But now, with the available
                              technology, we are leveraging it.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              With strong leadership from our director, we
                              established a rigorous process to align and share
                              the same copy across our UX documents and the
                              code. This streamlined the translation process,
                              eliminating the need to wait for the build to be
                              ready. The initial effort to audit and ensure all
                              text elements (strings) within the apps were
                              perfectly aligned was intense. My team needed to
                              check line by line, pairing the copy and reviewing
                              discrepancies, while mimicking how the development
                              team built the code. This involved detailed
                              reviews, context explanations, and collaboration
                              with different teams to ensure accuracy.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              This is still a work in progress, but perfect
                              alignment on strings is facilitating smoother
                              integration of translations into the app. Although
                              we are not finished, as our ecosystem is complex
                              with various platforms, versions, and supporting
                              products, we can already see the benefits of this
                              hard work.

                           The journey from forming a UX Design team with little
                           to no knowledge of translation and localization to
                           executing a high-speed localization strategy has been
                           transformative. By focusing on creating a
                           comprehensive glossary, designing with a global
                           mindset, developing detailed responsive specs, and
                           ensuring perfect alignment of strings, my team has
                           built a solid foundation for our global expansion.
                           Reflecting on the extended cross-functional team
                           capabilities, our ability to collectively adapt and
                           lead through uncertainty has positioned us to enter
                           new markets swiftly and confidently. I am proud to be
