                              Managing larger teams with varying levels of
                              engagement, seniority, and diverse skill sets
                              presents unique challenges. This was the situation
                              within the UX organization at Insulet Corporation,
                              where navigating a mix of over fifty individuals
                              across five disciplines required innovative
                              solutions and collaborative leadership,
                              particularly after an organizational restructure.
                              Leading this project as part of a Six Sigma
                              initiative made me reflect on the skills needed in
                              the near and mid-term future, and how these skills
                              are connected to team growth, both as a group and
                              at an individual level.
                           </p>

                           <h5>Outcome</h5>
                           <p>
                              Managers and teams collaborated to craft effective
                              solutions through open dialogue, where anonymity
                              was provided when necessary, allowing teams to
                              share their aspirations freely. This initiative
                              set a framework for the team to take charge of
                              their development paths, not as a way to defer
                              responsibility from the UX leadership, but to
                              provide ownership and empower each individual to
                              find their preferred methods, interaction style
                              and pace. Aligned with Insulet's policies and
                              development model, the framework offers
                              opportunities for everyone, regardless of
                              seniority, personality type, or available time.
                              Since we have set a scalable framework for the
                              team to own and expand, the final solution is yet
                              to be seen.

                              As for the future skills to pursue, I believe
                              curiosity, positive skepticism and perspective are
                              still crucial to differentiate the value and
                              impact of a solution. As William Gibson wrote, "We
                              have no future because our present is too
                              volatile. We have only risk management. The
                              spinning of the given moment's scenarios. Pattern
                              recognition.”

                           <p>
                              After conducting a thorough analysis of Insulet’s
                              engagement survey data spanning from 2022 to 2024,
                              it became evident that career growth remained an
                              area requiring attention. Recognizing the need for
                              a cohesive approach, I strategically implemented a
                              blend of Six Sigma and Service Design
                              methodologies. This initiative aimed to foster
                              open dialogue and active participation among
                              managers from various disciplines and over 50 team
                              members, regardless of their seniority or
                              background, in order to collaboratively devise
                              solutions to enhance career growth opportunities.

                                 Rather than implementing top-down directives,
                                 the process began with an anonymous survey
                                 customized for our teams, followed by other
                                 research methods. The results revealed detailed
                                 needs and pain points in the current
                                 experience. Using these insights, I defined
                                 personas and behavioral segments, generated the
                                 SIPOC process, current and future customer

                                 staff members. It also revealed additional
                                 demands, but it was necessary to prioritize
                                 those related to career growth.

                                 collaborated with UX leadership and HR Business
                                 Partner to establish key performance indicators

                                    career path experiences, aligning with HR

                                    members. This environment of psychological
                                    safety and trust enabled constructive
                                    interactions and collective problem-solving.
                                    At the manager level, I advocated for
                                    scalable solutions leveraging the strengths

                                    the team.

                                 Despite the challenge of finding time for
                                 implementation amid daily tasks, it was
                                 gratifying to see managers and team members
                                 collaborating and contributing
                                 enthusiastically. Considering all the feedback
                                 and solutions during the ideation phase, I
                                 developed and implemented a plan to enhance

                                 methodologies for efficiency and quality.

                                 The initiative included establishing a new

                                 guides, recommendations for courses,
                                 certifications, and conferences for formal
                                 training. Furthermore, we initiated a program
                                 for team members to interview subject matter
                                 experts, share insights from courses they’ve
                                 taken, and more.

                                 peer mentoring. Lastly, we offered

                                 members to engage in existing projects as UX
                                 professionals within the company and encouraged

                        Deciding and designing a career path can be
                        overwhelming, our collective approach is a development

                        scalability. Although this project is aligned with
                        Insulet's skill framework and the team needs identified
                        by UX leadership, it is also open enough for each person
