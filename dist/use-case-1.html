                              In the dynamic world of User Experience, managing
                              larger teams with varying levels of engagement and
                              diverse skill sets presents unique challenges.
                              This was the situation within the UX organization
                              at Insulet Corporation, where navigating a mix of
                              talent of over fifty individuals across five
                              disciplines, amidst conflicting motivations,
                              required innovative solutions and collaborative
                              leadership.

                           <p>
                              In navigating the challenges of diverse remote
                              teams, managers and teams joined forces to craft
                              solutions. Trust was cultivated through open
                              dialogue, as teams shared their aspirations, met
                              with supportive responses from managers. A
                              scalable approach emerged, featuring an internal
                              site for easy resource access, showcasing several
                              new initiatives empowering the team to take
                              ownership, guided by experienced, trustworthy, and
                              supportive UX leadership.

                           <p>
                              After conducting a thorough analysis of Insulet’s
                              engagement survey data spanning from 2022 to 2023,
                              it became evident that career growth remained an
                              area requiring attention. Recognizing the need for
                              a cohesive approach, I strategically implemented a
                              blend of Six Sigma and Service Design
                              methodologies. This initiative aimed to foster
                              open dialogue and active participation among
                              managers from various disciplines and over 50 team
                              members, regardless of their seniority or
                              background, in order to collaboratively devise
                              solutions to enhance career growth opportunities.
                           </p>

                              <p>
                                 Rather than implementing top-down directives,
                                 the process began with an anonymous survey
                                 customized for our teams, followed by
                                 personalized one-on-one sessions. This ensured
                                 that responses were aligned with the UX
                                 organization, which had recently undergone
                                 reorganization and expanded to include two
                                 additional disciplines: Human Factors and
                                 Instructional Design, in addition to the
                                 existing User Research, Design, and Technical
                                 Writing.

                              <p>
                                 The results revealed detailed needs and pain
                                 points in the current experience. Using these
                                 insights, I defined personas and behavioral
                                 segments, generated the SIPOC process, current
                                 and future customer journey. This approach
                                 proved effective as it acknowledged the diverse
                                 behaviors and motivations of the team, from
                                 associates to staff members. It also revealed
                                 additional demands, but it was necessary to
                                 prioritize those related to career growth.

                                    I facilitated the identification of root
                                    causes and areas for improvement using
                                    fishbone diagrams and the 5 Whys method. The
                                    UX management supported the ongoing
                                    validation of ideas with the team to enhance
                                    career path experiences, aligning with HR
                                    initiatives aimed at individual professional
                                    development.

                                    Central to this approach was fostering a
                                    culture of collaboration and mutual respect,
                                    encouraging active participation from all
                                    members. This environment of psychological
                                    safety and trust enabled constructive
                                    interactions and collective problem-solving.
                                    At the manager level, I advocated for
                                    scalable solutions leveraging the strengths
                                    of five UX managers and other professionals
                                    at Insulet, ensuring stable and accessible
                                    resources for the team.

                                 I developed and implemented a plan to enhance
                                 processes, incorporating Six Sigma
                                 methodologies for efficiency and quality.
                                 Although challenging to find time for
                                 implementation amid daily tasks, it was
                                 gratifying to witness team members
                                 collaborating and contributing
                                 enthusiastically.

                                 Some of the initiatives undertaken included the
                                 establishment of a new intranet site serving as
                                 a comprehensive resource hub with quick links
                                 and how-to guides. This site provided
                                 recommendations for courses, certifications,
                                 and conferences for formal training.
                                 Furthermore, we curated recordings and
                                 interviews from subject matter experts, along
                                 with insights from team members on courses
                                 they've taken.

                                 We facilitated opportunities to run or join
                                 training watch parties, as well as access
                                 mentoring resources for various formats such as
                                 one-on-one, group, or peer mentoring. Lastly,
                                 we offered learning-by-doing opportunities to
                                 engage in existing projects as UX professionals
                                 within the company, and encouraged project
                                 proposals through easy-to-follow guides.

                        Managing professional growth in a diverse, remote, and
                        expansive UX team poses both challenges and
                        opportunities for advancement and innovation. Employing
                        an integrated strategy that merges systematic
                        problem-solving and iterative design principles with a
                        scalable mindset has yielded positive results. This
